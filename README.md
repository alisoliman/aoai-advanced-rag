# Azure OpenAI Advanced RAG Techniques (WIP)

This repository features Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate workflows for document processing, retrieval, and evaluation using Azure OpenAI services.

Key Features:

### Test Set Generation:
Load documents, generate test sets with different evaluation types, and save them for further inspection.

### Parent-child Retrieval:
Chunk documents and use Azure OpenAI models for retrieval and question answering, with performance metrics such as relevancy and recall.

### Hierarchical Indexing:
Implement a two-tier retrieval system using document summaries and detailed chunks for efficient, context-aware information retrieval, with asynchronous processing to handle large datasets.

Use Cases:
AI test set generation, advanced document retrieval, and scalable, context-aware information retrieval.
